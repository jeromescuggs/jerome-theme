## zshrome

i might be going insane. i could have sworn, when i first used the 'dieter' theme from the default oh-my-zsh theme folder, that the colorscheme was a pleasant green,  blue, white and yellow. perhaps i was using a particular base16[] theme that made the hostname yellow, but for whatever reason that's what i saw, only to later find that applying the 'dieter' theme left me with a hostname that was colored white.

### v1 

this theme is basically dieter, with exactly one change: the hostname is no longer white, but rather, it is yellow. 

### v2

i really wanted to turn my prompt into an ASCII rendering of a Zaku, from mobile suit gundam. didn't have much luck, but i really couldn't just walk away from the idea. so i kept the infamous monoeye, in the form of a single red unicode bullet. it serves no purpose other than to remind you that terminals still have issues rendering unicode characters!

i like this subtle stylistic difference. you should as well. it is, as they say in dieter's homeland, "good scheisse".
