## zshrome

i might be going insane. i could have sworn, when i first used the 'dieter' theme from the default oh-my-zsh theme folder, that the colorscheme was a pleasant green,  blue, white and yellow. perhaps i was using a particular base16[] theme that made the hostname yellow, but for whatever reason that's what i saw, only to later find that applying the 'dieter' theme left me with a hostname that was colored white.

this theme is basically dieter, with exactly one change: the hostname is no longer white, but rather, it is yellow. 

i like this subtle stylistic difference. you should as well. it is, as they say in dieter's homeland, "good scheisse".
