## zshrome

i might be going insane. i could have sworn, when i first used the 'dieter' theme from the default oh-my-zsh theme folder, that the colorscheme was a pleasant blue, white and yellow. perhaps i was using a particular base16[] theme that caused this. 

this theme is basically dieter, with exactly one change: the hostname is no longer white, but rather, it is yellow. 

i like this subtle stylistic difference. you should as well. it is, as they say in dieter's homeland, "good scheisse".
